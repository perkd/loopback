## Migration Guidelines
- use the `enhancements.md` file to guide the migration
- always verify changes against original logic in the corresponding file (with '-org' suffix) in the 'original' folder where available

## Test Scripts
- do not modify test scripts to pass tests, unless it is verifed that test script is incorrect
- use promises by default unless explicitly testing callback functionality
