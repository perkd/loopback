# Migration Guidelines
- use the `enhancements.md` file to guide the migration
- always verify changes against original logic in the corresponding file (with '-org' suffix) in the 'original' folder where available
- files in the 'original' folder are not modified, only used for reference
- use async/await where possible when using native promises

# Test Scripts
- do not modify test scripts to pass tests, unless it is verifed that test script is incorrect
- use promises by default unless explicitly testing callback functionality
- when explicitly migrating test scripts from callback to promises:
   - comment out tests that are stated explicitly for testing callback functionality (for legacy documentation)
- test timeouts mostly due to unresolved promises or logic errors, not slow response. Refrain from increasing timeouts

# Loopback Dependencies
- assume these packages uses native promises:
    - loopback-datasource-juggler
    - strong-remoting
